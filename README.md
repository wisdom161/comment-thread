## Usage
1. Enter your name and comment in the form below `Say something`
2. Click on the `Comment` button to submit your comment
3. Click on the `reply` to bring out the reply form
4. Enter your name and reply and click on the `Reply` button to reply to a comment.

## Please note
1. This app is not completely finished, there were plans to add more styling and have the replies render dynamically based on which comment was being replied to.
2. As the App grew, I realized that utilizing React Hooks or Redux would have been beneficial for state management - future plans would include refactoring the code base to better maintain the state.
